# Anti-Covid-Room
The rising cases, subsequent lockdown and restrictions encouraged us to work towards improving circumstances for the better. Our aim was to minimize the risk of anyone going out. Another issue we wanted to work on was the condition of local businesses. We wanted to solve these issues and try to make life as close to normal as possible. We successfully achieved this by making the Anti Covid Room Product  which fulfills both of our objectives.
We divided the product into 3 ,
The first part is the temperature checker which measures the temperature of the visitor. 
Second Part is the automatic sanitizer dispenser which dispenses sanitizer when its sensor detects movement. 
The final part is the people counter which counts the number of people in the room and makes sure it does not exceed a particular count.
