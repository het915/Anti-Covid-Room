# Anti-Covid-Room
The rising cases, subsequent lockdown and restrictions encouraged us to work towards improving circumstances for the better. Our aim was to minimize the risk of anyone going out. Another issue we wanted to work on was the condition of local businesses. We wanted to solve these issues and try to make life as close to normal as possible. We successfully achieved this by making the Covishield Room which fulfills both of our objectives. While working on the project, we made many corrections which helped maximize the efficiency and effectivity of our project. We were initially going to use a website to display live data. Since, we could not find a way to do that using Arduino, the people counter was made using the ESP32 microcontroller. Once we had this, we decided to use IOT to display the live data. Other than this, most of our project was made according to the initial plan.
